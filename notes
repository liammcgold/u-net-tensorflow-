-Batch Normalization on output or input is no good and causes banding
-learning rate must be VERY low, (0.00005)
-affinites are in (up (positive z), right (x), forward (y))
-d2 instead of c3 is being upsampled and merged, thus c3 is a dead end and wasteful, need to fix this when restarting training
